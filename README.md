# NITHIN KUMAR KUNCHALA'S Projects

Welcome to my projects portfolio! I am **Nithin Kumar Kunchala**, a passionate and driven computer science student currently pursuing my BTech in CSE (Data Science). My goal is to solve real-world problems through technology and become a software engineer at a top tech company. I'm constantly learning and evolving in the field of machine learning, software development, and algorithms.

This repository showcases my journey through some of the projects I've worked on so far, with many more exciting and complex projects to come. Each project folder contains detailed documentation and the codebase for individual projects.

## Completed Projects

### 1. Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
- **Overview**: This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using natural language processing techniques. It explores various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- **Technologies**: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NLTK
- [Explore Project](Fake_new_detection/README.md)

### 2. Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
- **Overview**: A web-based visualizer for common sorting algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort. The interface allows users to select the sorting algorithm, control the speed of the visualization, and observe how the algorithms work step-by-step.
- **Technologies**: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
- [Explore Project](./Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer/README.md)

### 3. Notepad Clone using Java AWT and Swing
- **Overview**: A simple Notepad clone built using Java's AWT and Swing libraries. This project replicates basic Notepad functionalities such as creating, editing, saving, and opening text files. The goal was to learn and apply GUI programming concepts in Java.
- **Technologies**: Java, AWT, Swing
- [Explore Project](./Notepad_Clone/README.md)

## Future Projects and Potential

I believe in continuously challenging myself with more complex and innovative projects. In the near future, I plan to explore:

- **Deep Learning**: Implement advanced models such as LSTM, RNNs, and BERT for natural language tasks.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Build large-scale applications with microservices architecture, focusing on performance, scalability, and cloud deployment.
- **Blockchain Technology**: Experiment with decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.
- **AI and Data Science**: Work on real-time machine learning applications, including reinforcement learning and deep learning-based models.

## My Mission

I am passionate about creating impactful solutions using technology. I believe that through continuous learning and the pursuit of excellence, I can contribute to innovative and meaningful projects that make a difference. This repository is just the beginning of my journey, and I am excited to share more as I grow as a developer and a problem-solver.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders and stay tuned for more updates!
